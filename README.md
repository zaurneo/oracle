# Oracle

This project relies on several API keys which are loaded from a `.env` file. A sample `.env` is included in the repository but contains placeholder values only.

## Providing API Keys
1. Copy the `.env` file and replace each `YOUR_*` placeholder with your real credentials.
2. Alternatively, set the corresponding environment variables in your shell before running the program.

The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore`, so any personal keys you place there will not be committed if you change it locally.

Once your keys are in place you can execute the project modules as usual, for example:

```bash
python main.py
```
